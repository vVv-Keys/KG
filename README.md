# KeysGuard Recon Engine

**KeysGuard Recon Engine** is a modular, AI-assisted offensive security toolkit designed for full-scope reconnaissance, vulnerability detection, and API exploitation analysis. Rebuilt from the Reaper framework and hardened for red team workflows, KeysGuard empowers security researchers with:

- 🔍 Advanced scanning profiles (Web App, API, WAF Evasion, Logic Flaws)
- 🧠 AI agent integration with intelligent fuzzing and reporting
- ⚙️ Plug-and-play compatibility with `httpx`, `nuclei`, `amass`, and more
- 📤 Professional CVSS vulnerability reports with PoCs and remediation
- 🔔 Optional webhook alerting to Discord or SIEM

Whether you’re hunting bugs or mapping entire attack surfaces, KeysGuard is the engine behind next-gen recon.

> Built by red teamers, for red teamers. Powered by AI. Rebuilt and REINNOVATED by Keys.


I will develop this project more as time goes on sorry for the poor upload quality and structure in advance. 

Will have chatgpt generate setup instructions for me once the script is fully compiled and working.
